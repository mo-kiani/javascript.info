# javascript.info
My attempts of the coding tasks in the JS tutorials at javascript.info

### Task Codes
Tasks will be identified with 4 dot separated numbers.  

The first number is the 'Part' of the website.  
The second number is the section within the given part.  
The third number is the page/tutorial within the given section.  
The fourth number is the number of the task within the given tutorial.  

*Not all tutorials have tasks.*  

*Tasks are not explicitly numbered, the numbers represent relative order.*  

For example, `1.2.15.3` represents `The JavaScript Language -> JavaScript 
Fundamentals -> Functions -> Task "Function min(a, b)"`
