# javascript.info
My attempts of the coding tasks in the JS tutorials at javascript.info

### Task Codes
Tasks will be identified with 4 dot separated numbers.  

The first number is the 'Part' of the website.  
The second number is the section within the given part.  
The third number is the page/tutorial within the given section.  
The fourth number is the number of the task within the given tutorial.  

*Not all tutorials have tasks.*  

*Tasks are not explicitly numbered, the numbers represent relative order.*  

For example, `1.2.15.3` represents `The JavaScript Language -> JavaScript 
Fundamentals -> Functions -> Task "Function min(a, b)"`

### File/Folder Naming/Numbering Convenvtion
If numbers are used to indicate order of files/folders, the names within the 
same sequence should share the same prefix before the number. Names that share a
sequence should use the minimal amount of zero-padding required to make all 
numbers take uniform space. This is to visually align numbers in a sequence,
avoid unnecessary padding, and to ensure that lexicographic ordering sorts 
numbered files/folders appropriately.
