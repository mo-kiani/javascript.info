# Task 1.2.4.3


### Desired Code

```
const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982';
const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY);
```

### Explanation

Your birthday is a hardcoded value that is universally constant, so using the
uppercase variable naming convention is appropriate. 

It is very likely that your age stays the same throughout the execution of the 
code, and so declaring it as a constant is appropriate. However, the age is
calculated at runtime rather than hardcoded into the code text, and it is not a
universal constant because by one year from now it will have incremented, so 
it's name should follow the regular camelCase convention.
