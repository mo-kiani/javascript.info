# Task 1.6.3.5

It will alert `Hello, John`.  

Even though the function is declared inside the block, function declarations
work more like the `var` keyword rather than the `let` keyword and therefore
belong to the entire function where they are declared and the scope of their
definition is not limited by non-function code blocks like `if`.
